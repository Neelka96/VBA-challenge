# Important Information
**Made for EdX & UT Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp: Cohort UTA-VIRT-DATA-PT-11-2024-U-LOLC.** 

Script is a macro written in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) for use solely with Microsoft Excel files types and has only been tested with .xlsm and .xlsx file formats.

This is the second module completed in the course!

This README.md was written using tips and tricks from [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

For all citations please see [VBA-challenge Citations](#vba-challenge-citations).

## Module Purpose
Module's purpose is to analyze a large amount of data held on multiple pages of a workbook. The data consists of daily stock values and the objective is to provide a summary for each one on each sheet, along with a smaller summary for each worksheet. After an examination of the data, the module creates new tables of data with corresponding formatting and headers that will be filled in with computations that have been run on each grouping of stock tickers to create the summaries. The workbook and any worksheets within it should only update after the module finishes its execution along with message boxes declaring the macro a success and lisitng the execution time.

## CURRENT METHOD:
```
<Run Macro>
--> Disable application update features
--> Begin loop through each worksheet
--> Copies data and perserves formatting/arrangement in same 2D array dimensions
--> Runs data through tests in local memory
--> Stores results in two new 2D arrays
--> Two new arrays with headings and formatting printed back to workshees
--> Loop to next worksheet
--> Success! Re-enable application update features to see changes
--> Print message box stating success and execution time
<End Macro>
```

## Detailed Description of Module
Built to work with daily entries of various stocks and their associated values listed in one or more worksheets. Suboutine takes the input of a workbook and copies pre-organized data within the workbook (and its dimensions) to the temporary memory of local computer in the form of a variant array. The array data include the stock name, date of entry, the opening, high, low, and closing prices, and volume for each entry. The sample data given by the class has the workbook seperated into quarters and the stocks grouped by tickers which makes comparing groups of stocks easier. 

Looping within the new array, it only pauses at new stock tickers to compute the statistics of the prior range of stock tickers. The module will summarize the data for each stock ticker group and working one quarter at a time until the output is completed. The computations are stored in two new 2D arrays on computer by grouping of stock ticker. After new arrays are built, data is printed back to each worksheet with macro-based conditional formatting. Finally, the module permits the Microsoft Excel UI to resume updates before subroutine end.

> [!NOTE]
> [Current subroutine](/2oStockRoutine.bas) is now built using arrays to handle large quantities of data with rapid efficiency! [Previous subroutine](/1oStockRoutine.bas) ran by continuously accessing Microsoft Excel Ranges in the workbook and storing all temporary data within the sheet, however it executed at only 20% of the speed of current mode.

## Current Limitations
- [ ] Runs only with Microsoft Excel Workbooks.
- [ ] Stock tickers don't have to be in alphabetical order, but they MUST be grouped by ticker name.
- [ ] Stock tickers in the same group MUST be in exact chronological order (Earliest date --> Latest Date).
- [ ] Input format must be: {Rows} x {Columns} --> {Ticker, date, open, high, low close, volume} x {Daily stock entries}
- [ ] Input data is NOT verified/formatted/cleansed by module - adding said functionality has not been addressed.
